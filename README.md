# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Dataset: https://studio.code.org/data_docs/college-majors

- **Major** (String) - Name of the specific major
- **MajorCategory** (String) - Name of the general category the major is in
- **UnemploymentRate** (double) - Unemployment rate of a specific major
- **Median** (int) - The median pay for a specific major rounded to the thousands

## Video Demo

Record a short video of your abstract art animation to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.
- Use the following markdown

## Description

Our project used a dataset that contained information about majors and their median incomes and unemployment rates, we decided to have each main peice of evidence sorted into a 1D array. We then wrote methods that would give us the maximum values for incomes, and the minimum values for unemployment, and methods to find the majors for each of those certain values. We decided this program could help users who wanted to see what majors had better job security, or what majors paid the most. To add visuals, we also put in text that displayed the values and inserted some images and sounds to keep user attention.
